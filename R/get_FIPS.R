#'Get the FIPS code for the selected data.
#'@name get_FIPS
#'@description The function will fetch and return the FIPS for the counties of interest.
#'    As some counties will change due to various causes, it is easier to track the counties
#'    by FIPS code for a long-term analysis.  Description of FIPS codes is available via
#'    \code{[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code)}
#'
#'#'@param data the dataset to work with, generally the full usfertilizer or its subsets.
#'@param counties counties of interest, defalut: all avaible counties.
#'@param states states of interest, defalt: all avaialble states.
#'@param overlap_state_county Logic. If true, the function will overlaping
#'       the input of states and counties. If false, the function will return
#'       results either in the states or in the counties.
#'@param combine_state_county Logic. If true, the county will be changed into
#'       county, state, e.g. Wake, NC; If false, no changes.
#'@return A tibble with tidy data.
